You are saying goodbye to someone that's no longer in your life (dead?)
- You are together with your someone having a nice time, and they start
running away through a whole in the ground. You follow.
- Levels start. You start finding letters. They are memories with you and 
that person (the player does not know that)
- You find some fruit (candy?). It's your someone favourite fruit, 
so you need to collect it all.
- You find npcs, they try to help you find the someone. 
At the begining they give you indications.
In the end you start seeing what's going on, you don't need indications,
you need closure
- You see your someone, you find clousure, you let go. 
-The game ends.
